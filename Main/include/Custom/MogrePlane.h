    A plane is defined in 3D space by the equation
    Ax + By + Cz + D = 0

    This equates to a vector (the normal of the plane, whose x, y
    and z components equate to the coefficients A, B and C
    respectively), and a constant (D) which is the distance along
    the normal you have to go to move the plane back to the origin.
